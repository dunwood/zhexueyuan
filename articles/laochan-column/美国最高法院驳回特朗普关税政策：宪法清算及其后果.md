### 引言

2026年2月20日，美国最高法院在一项具有里程碑意义的裁决中，在合并审理的*Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* 和 *Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc.* 案件中，以6-3的票数裁定，唐纳德·J·特朗普总统通过1977年《国际紧急经济权力法》（IEEPA）实施的全面关税超出了其法定授权范围。 此裁决推翻了特朗普第二任期经济议程的核心支柱，包括2025年4月实施的所谓“解放日”关税，这些关税针对几乎所有美国贸易伙伴，税率从10%到某些情况下超过145%。 该决定不仅废除了估计已征收超过1600亿美元收入的关税，还重新点燃了关于总统权力界限、美国宪法中权力分立以及行政行动与司法监督之间互动的辩论。

特朗普将这些关税辩护为对“异常和特别威胁”的回应，例如贸易逆差、来自墨西哥、加拿大的毒品流入以及更广泛的经济失衡。 然而，法院认为IEEPA赋予总统在国家紧急状态下“调节……进口”的权力，并不延伸到征收关税，因为此类权力根据宪法第一条第八款保留给国会。 首席大法官约翰·G·罗伯茨Jr. 为多数意见撰写，强调总统对IEEPA的解释代表了对单方面征税权力的“异常”主张，而没有明确的国会授权。 本文从学术视角审视该裁决的影响，重点关注总统权力与司法机构的关系、裁决的法律意义、对美国政治和经济的影响、特朗普的即时反应以及对其潜在对策的预测。通过借鉴宪法理论、历史先例和经济分析，我们可以辨识这一决定如何重塑美国治理和全球贸易格局。

### 总统权力、行政权力与司法审查：宪法框架

美国宪法确立了一个三权分立的政府体系，旨在防止权力集中在任何一个分支机构。第一条赋予国会“征收和收取税收、关税、进口税和消费税”的权力，明确将关税作为一种税收形式。 这一分配反映了制宪者意图，确保影响民众的财政政策源于最接近人民的立法机构，回荡着革命口号“无代表不纳税”。 行政分支根据第二条被赋予执行法律的权力，但缺乏在和平时期征收关税的固有权力，正如特朗普政府在其论据中承认的那样。

随着时间推移，国会通过诸如IEEPA之类的法规向总统委托有限的贸易权力，该法于1977年颁布，以遏制越南战争和水门事件后行政越权的现象。 IEEPA允许总统宣布国家紧急状态并调节外国经济交易，但它明确排除关税，重点关注资产冻结、制裁和出口管制。 特朗普援引IEEPA征收广泛关税代表了对这一权力的新型扩张，在总统历史上前所未有。 法院的裁决重申了非委托原则，该原则要求国会为行政行动提供“可理解的原则”，正如在*J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States* (1928) 案件中阐述的那样。 罗伯茨指出，将“调节进口”解释为包括无限关税，将构成在缺乏明确法定语言的情况下的大规模委托，违反权力分立。

这一决定呼应了历史上司法对行政越权的干预，例如*Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* (1952)，法院在那起案件中推翻了杜鲁门总统在朝鲜战争期间对钢铁厂的扣押。 在*Youngstown* 中，杰克逊大法官的附议意见概述了总统权力的框架：当与国会授权一致时最大化，当与之相反时最小化。 特朗普的关税落入后者类别，因为国会未在IEEPA下明确授权此类广泛征收。 该裁决因此提醒了司法机构在经济政策中的作用，作为对行政单边主义的制衡，特别是总统们日益依赖紧急声明来绕过立法僵局。 学者如路易斯·费舍尔长期批评这一趋势，认为它侵蚀了民主问责制。 通过拒绝特朗普的解释，法院维护了国会贸易政策的首要地位，可能鼓励未来立法机构收回委托权力。

### 裁决的法律含义： “违法”意味着什么？

法院宣布特朗普的关税在IEEPA下违法，具有深远的法律分量。它废除了根据该法规征收的所有关税，包括对超过50个国家的互惠关税以及针对毒品贩运国家的针对性关税。 这并不追溯性地废除征收，但为退款打开了大门，估计可能超过1750亿美元，正如耶鲁预算实验室估计的那样。 该案被发回下级法院，如美国国际贸易法院，以确定退款机制，这可能涉及复杂的行政程序，有利于较大的进口商。

从法律上讲，该裁决澄清了IEEPA中的“调节”并不包括征税，借鉴了文本主义和历史语境。 没有先前的总统使用IEEPA征收关税，而国会已在其他地方明确委托此类权力，例如1962年《贸易扩展法》第232条针对国家安全威胁。 这一精确性限制了未来的行政主张，要求征收关税需有“明确的国会授权”。 持异议者，包括托马斯、阿利托和卡瓦诺大法官，主张对IEEPA更广泛的解读，但多数意见的分裂——由自由派和保守派联合——突显了在遏制行政越权上的意识形态趋同。 戈萨奇大法官的附议批评了特朗普与先前政府先例应用的不一致，突显了司法尊重的紧张关系。

该决定的违法性暗示了政府潜在的责任，尽管主权豁免可能保护官员。它还邀请了对其他基于紧急情况行动的挑战，重申了《国家紧急状态法》对国会监督的要求。 总之，该裁决意味着紧急权力不能在核心财政领域替代立法同意，恢复了宪法平衡，在行政主张上升的时代。

### 政治影响：对特朗普主义的打击与制度动态

从政治上讲，该裁决对特朗普来说是一次罕见的失败，他曾在最高法院享有“几乎连续不断的胜利”。 它削弱了他对不受限制行政力量的叙事，这是其“美国优先”议程的核心，并暴露了共和党内部的裂痕。 共和党议员赞扬了该决定，突显了保护主义与自由贸易之间的分歧。 对民主党来说，它验证了对特朗普威权倾向的批评，可能通过将该裁决框架为宪法规范的胜利，来加强2026年中期选举竞选。

该决定肯定了法院的独立性，反驳了尽管特朗普任命了三位大法官的党派偏见感知。 巴雷特和戈萨奇对特朗普的投票表明意识形态并不保证忠诚，回荡了罗伯茨在维护《平价医疗法案》中的作用。 这可能侵蚀特朗普对司法的影响力，促使他对“不忠”保守派的攻击，并助长民粹主义修辞。 在全球范围内，它削弱了美国在谈判中的影响力，因为欧盟和加拿大等盟友可能要求重新谈判缓解关税的协议。 在国内，它可能鼓励国会改革紧急权力，正如《第一条法案》提议的那样。 总体而言，该裁决进一步政治化了贸易，加深了极化，同时强化了制度制衡。

### 经济影响：缓解、不确定性和全球涟漪

从经济上讲，该废除移除了负责特朗普征收约70%的关税，可能退款1420-1750亿美元。 这可能通过降低进口商成本来刺激增长，特别是零售和制造业的小企业。 研究显示，美国消费者承担了大部分关税负担，价格上涨0.4-1%，通胀持续。 移除它们可能将有效税率从16%降至9%，缓解通胀压力，并长期提升GDP 0.3%。

然而，由于特朗普的反制措施，不确定性持续存在，可能抵消收益。 市场最初反弹，但面临来自中国等伙伴报复行动的波动。 在加利福尼亚，受关税影响的港口和农场可能恢复，但更广泛的供应链中断持续。 在全球范围内，该裁决注入了不稳定性，因为重新谈判的协议可能瓦解，损害美国出口。 经济学家预测，如果退款进行，宏观影响温和，但旷日持久的诉讼可能抑制投资。 该决定突显了关税的累退性质，对低收入家庭的影响不成比例。

### 特朗普的反应：反抗与修辞升级

特朗普的回应具有典型的对抗性。在白宫新闻发布会上，他抨击法院为“耻辱”，称多数派为“傻瓜和走狗”，并对其任命的巴雷特和戈萨奇表达“耻辱”。 他谴责该裁决为“可怕”和“反美”，将其框架为司法越权破坏国家安全。 在数小时内，他签署了一项行政命令，根据1974年《贸易法》第122条征收10%的全球关税，后来提高至15%。 在Truth Social上，他攻击“不忠”的共和党人，并誓言“更严厉的步骤”。 这种修辞符合特朗普将失败个人化的模式，正如其2020年选举后挑战所见。 副总统JD·万斯附和他，将该决定称为“无法无天”。

### 预测的反制措施：法律途径与挑战

特朗普的团队已表示采用多管齐下的策略来规避该裁决。 首先，援引第122条允许为应对国际收支赤字临时征收15%的关税，为期150天，而无需紧急状态。 这争取了时间，但需要国会延长，邀请法律挑战。 其次，对“不公平”做法的第301条调查可在调查后证明针对性关税合理，尽管不是即时替代。 第三，扩展第232条国家安全关税于钢铁、铝等很可能，尽管过去受到批评。 财政部长斯科特·贝森特表示，这些可维持收入水平。

预测表明，特朗普可能根据其他法规追求禁运或配额，但这些在裁决后面临司法审查。 法律专家预计诉讼，因为第122条的使用未经测试。 从政治上讲，他可能游说国会获得明确授权，尽管僵局持续。 从经济上讲，反制措施可能维持波动，退款抵消新成本。 最终，这些努力测试了裁决的持久性，可能导致进一步的最高法院干预。

### 结论

美国最高法院驳回特朗普关税的决定标志着美国宪法法中的关键时刻，重申了司法机构在行政扩张中的监护作用。从法律上讲，它遏制了基于紧急情况的单边主义；从政治上讲，它削弱了特朗普的议程，同时暴露了共和党的裂痕；从经济上讲，它提供了缓解，但伴随不确定性。特朗普的反抗反应及其预测的反制措施——利用替代法规——表明持续冲突，但该决定持久地限制了总统越权，确保贸易政策仍是共享领域。随着美国在2026年的政治格局中航行，这一裁决突显了在极化治理时代宪法制衡的韧性。

### The Supreme Court's Rejection of Trump's Tariff Policy: A Constitutional Reckoning and Its Ramifications

### Introduction

In a landmark decision on February 20, 2026, the United States Supreme Court, in the consolidated cases of *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* and *Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc.*, ruled 6-3 that President Donald J. Trump exceeded his statutory authority by imposing sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. This ruling invalidated tariffs that had been a cornerstone of Trump's second-term economic agenda, including the so-called "Liberation Day" tariffs imposed in April 2025, which targeted nearly all U.S. trading partners with duties ranging from 10% to over 145% in some cases. The decision not only struck down tariffs estimated to have collected over $160 billion in revenue but also reignited debates over the boundaries of presidential power, the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution, and the interplay between executive actions and judicial oversight.

The tariffs in question were justified by Trump as responses to "unusual and extraordinary threats" such as trade deficits, drug influxes from Mexico, Canada,  and broader economic imbalances. However, the Court held that IEEPA, which grants the president authority to "regulate... importation" during national emergencies, does not extend to imposing tariffs, as such powers are constitutionally reserved for Congress under Article I, Section 8. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, emphasized that the president's interpretation of IEEPA represented an "extraordinary" claim of unilateral taxing authority without explicit congressional delegation. This essay examines the ruling's implications through an academic lens, focusing on the dynamics of presidential authority vis-à-vis the judiciary, the legal significance of the decision, its political and economic impacts on the United States, Trump's immediate reactions, and predictions for his potential countermeasures. By drawing on constitutional theory, historical precedents, and economic analysis, we can discern how this decision reshapes the landscape of American governance and global trade.

### Presidential Authority, Executive Power, and Judicial Review: A Constitutional Framework

The U.S. Constitution establishes a tripartite system of government designed to prevent the concentration of power in any single branch. Article I vests Congress with the power "to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises," explicitly including tariffs as a form of taxation. This allocation reflects the Framers' intent to ensure that fiscal policies affecting the populace originate from the legislative body closest to the people, echoing the revolutionary cry of "no taxation without representation." The executive branch, under Article II, is granted authority to execute laws but lacks inherent peacetime power to impose tariffs, as conceded by the Trump administration in its arguments.

Over time, Congress has delegated limited trade authorities to the president through statutes like IEEPA, enacted in 1977 to curb executive overreach following the Vietnam War and Watergate scandals. IEEPA allows the president to declare national emergencies and regulate foreign economic transactions, but it explicitly excludes tariffs, focusing instead on asset freezes, sanctions, and export controls. Trump's invocation of IEEPA to impose broad tariffs represented a novel expansion of this authority, unprecedented in presidential history. The Court's ruling reaffirmed the nondelegation doctrine, a principle requiring Congress to provide an "intelligible principle" for executive actions, as articulated in cases like *J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States* (1928). Roberts noted that interpreting "regulate importation" to include unlimited tariffs would constitute a sweeping delegation absent clear statutory language, violating separation of powers.

This decision echoes historical judicial interventions in executive overreach, such as *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* (1952), where the Court invalidated President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War. In *Youngstown*, Justice Jackson's concurrence outlined a framework for presidential power: maximal when acting with congressional authorization, minimal when contrary to it. Trump's tariffs fell into the latter category, as Congress had not explicitly authorized such broad impositions under IEEPA. The ruling thus serves as a reminder of the judiciary's role as a check on executive unilateralism, particularly in economic policy where presidents have increasingly relied on emergency declarations to bypass legislative gridlock. Scholars like Louis Fisher have long critiqued this trend, arguing it erodes democratic accountability. By rejecting Trump's interpretation, the Court preserved congressional primacy in trade policy, potentially encouraging future legislatures to reclaim delegated powers.

### The Legal Implications of the Ruling: What Does "Unlawful" Mean?

The Court's declaration that Trump's tariffs were unlawful under IEEPA carries profound legal weight. It invalidates all duties imposed pursuant to the statute, including the reciprocal tariffs on over 50 countries and targeted duties on drug-trafficking nations. This does not retroactively nullify collections but opens the door for refunds, potentially exceeding $175 billion, as estimated by the Yale Budget Lab. The case was remanded to lower courts, such as the U.S. Court of International Trade, to determine refund mechanisms, which could involve complex administrative processes favoring larger importers.

Legally, the ruling clarifies that "regulate" in IEEPA does not encompass taxation, drawing on textualism and historical context. No prior president had used IEEPA for tariffs, and Congress has delegated such powers explicitly elsewhere, as in Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 for national security threats. This precision limits future executive claims, requiring "clear congressional authorization" for tariff impositions. Dissenters, including Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh, argued for a broader reading of IEEPA, but the majority's splintered opinion—joined by liberals and conservatives—highlights ideological convergence on curbing executive overreach. Justice Gorsuch's concurrence criticized inconsistent application of precedents between Trump and prior administrations, underscoring tensions in judicial deference.

The decision's unlawfulness implies potential liability for the administration, though sovereign immunity may shield officials. It also invites challenges to other emergency-based actions, reinforcing the National Emergencies Act's requirement for congressional oversight. In sum, the ruling means that emergency powers cannot substitute for legislative consent in core fiscal domains, restoring constitutional balance amid rising executive assertions.

### Political Impacts: A Blow to Trumpism and Institutional Dynamics

Politically, the ruling represents a rare defeat for Trump, who had enjoyed an "almost unbroken string of victories" at the Supreme Court. It undermines his narrative of unchecked executive strength, central to his "America First" agenda, and exposes fractures within the Republican Party. GOP lawmakers praised the decision, highlighting divisions over protectionism versus free trade. For Democrats, it validates critiques of Trump's authoritarian tendencies, potentially bolstering midterm campaigns in 2026 by framing the ruling as a win for constitutional norms.

The decision affirms the Court's independence, countering perceptions of partisanship despite Trump's appointments of three justices. Barrett and Gorsuch's votes against Trump signal that ideology does not guarantee loyalty, echoing Roberts' role in upholding the Affordable Care Act. This could erode Trump's influence over the judiciary, prompting attacks on "disloyal" conservatives and fueling populist rhetoric. Globally, it weakens U.S. leverage in negotiations, as allies like the EU and Canada may demand renegotiations of tariff-mitigating deals. Domestically, it may encourage congressional reforms to emergency powers, as proposed in bills like the ARTICLE ONE Act. Overall, the ruling politicizes trade further, deepening polarization while reinforcing institutional checks.

### Economic Impacts: Relief, Uncertainty, and Global Ripples

Economically, the invalidation removes tariffs responsible for about 70% of Trump's collections, potentially refunding $142-175 billion. This could stimulate growth by reducing costs for importers, particularly small businesses in retail and manufacturing. Studies show U.S. consumers bore most tariff burdens, with prices rising 0.4-1% and inflation persisting. Removing them might lower effective rates from 16% to 9%, easing inflationary pressures and boosting GDP by 0.3% long-term.

However, uncertainty lingers due to Trump's countermoves, potentially offsetting gains through new duties. Markets rallied initially but face volatility from retaliatory actions by partners like China. In California, ports and farms hit by tariffs could recover, but broader supply chain disruptions persist. Globally, the ruling injects instability, as renegotiated deals may unravel, harming U.S. exports. Economists predict modest macro effects if refunds proceed, but prolonged litigation could dampen investment. The decision highlights tariffs' regressive nature, disproportionately affecting low-income households.

### Trump's Reaction: Defiance and Rhetorical Escalation

Trump's response was characteristically combative. At a White House press conference, he lambasted the Court as a "disgrace," calling the majority "fools and lap dogs" and expressing "shame" for his appointees Barrett and Gorsuch. He decried the ruling as "terrible" and "anti-American," framing it as judicial overreach undermining national security. Within hours, he signed an executive order imposing a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, later raised to 15%. On Truth Social, he attacked "disloyal" Republicans and vowed "even tougher steps." This rhetoric aligns with Trump's pattern of personalizing defeats, as seen in his post-2020 election challenges. Vice President JD Vance echoed him, labeling the decision "lawlessness."

### Predicted Countermeasures: Legal Pathways and Challenges

Trump's team has signaled a multi-pronged strategy to circumvent the ruling. First, invoking Section 122 allows temporary 15% tariffs for 150 days to address balance-of-payments deficits, without needing emergencies. This buys time but requires congressional extension, inviting legal challenges. Second, Section 301 investigations into "unfair" practices could justify targeted tariffs after probes, though not immediate replacements. Third, expanding Section 232 national security tariffs on steel, aluminum, and more is likely, despite past criticisms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated these could maintain revenue levels.

Predictions suggest Trump may pursue embargoes or quotas under other statutes, but these face judicial scrutiny post-ruling. Legal experts anticipate lawsuits, as Section 122's use is untested. Politically, he could lobby Congress for explicit authorization, though gridlock persists. Economically, countermeasures may sustain volatility, with refunds offsetting new costs. Ultimately, these efforts test the ruling's durability, potentially leading to further Supreme Court interventions.

### Conclusion

The Supreme Court's rejection of Trump's tariffs marks a pivotal moment in American constitutional law, reaffirming the judiciary's guardianship of separation of powers amid executive expansions. Legally, it curtails emergency-based unilateralism; politically, it weakens Trump's agenda while exposing GOP fissures; economically, it offers relief tempered by uncertainty. Trump's defiant reactions and predicted countermeasures—leveraging alternative statutes—suggest ongoing conflict, but the decision enduringly limits presidential overreach, ensuring trade policy remains a shared domain. As the U.S. navigates 2026's political landscape, this ruling underscores the resilience of constitutional checks in an era of polarized governance.
